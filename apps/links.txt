What are the best Linux OCR programs?
o GOCR

o Tessaract OCR
Top Con - "Rudimentary image processing
Tesseract's image processing is very rudimentary,
in order to get the most out of it you need to use
a preprocessor or use an image that's already been
processed.  A for humans perfectly readable image
100 dpi results in a huge number of failed characters
even if source is free from physical scan artifacts 
(i.e. print to file).  If possible, it's better to
use 300 dpi image files."

o Cuneiform
